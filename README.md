Code for TNNLS Paper: Conditional Neural Heuristic for Multi-objective Vehicle Routing Problems

It contains the implementation codes for three multi-objective vehicle routing problems:

- Bi-objective traveling salesman problem(BiTSP).

- Bi-objective capability vehicle routing problem(BiCVRP).

- Tri-objective traveling salesman problem(TriTSP).

This code is adapted from the POMO repository (https://github.com/yd-kwon/POMO) and the PMOCO repository (https://github.com/Xi-L/PMOCO).

#### Quick Start

- To train a model, such as BiTSP, run train_motsp.py in the corresponding folder.

- To test a model, such as BiTSP, run test_motsp.py in the corresponding folder.

- Pretrained models for each problem can be found in the result folder.
